# Getting Started with Data Analysis Repository

## 📝 Overview
This repository provides an introduction to data analysis using Python and the Pandas library. The materials cover foundational concepts, ranging from importing and cleaning data to performing exploratory data analysis (EDA). Below, the content is summarized using the STAR method to highlight the key tasks and results from the lessons.

### 🧠 **Core Topics Covered**

1. **Importing Libraries and Datasets**
   - **Situation**: Setting up the environment for data analysis.
   - **Task**: Import necessary libraries (e.g., Pandas) and load datasets.
   - **Action**: Executed `import pandas as pd` and loaded CSV files using `pd.read_csv()`.
   - **Result**: Prepared data for subsequent analysis with a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Understanding the Dataset**
   - **Situation**: Analyzing the structure and content of the dataset.
   - **Task**: Use Pandas functions to explore dataset characteristics.
   - **Action**: Applied methods like `head()`, `tail()`, and `info()` to inspect data.
   - **Result**: Gained a preliminary understanding of the dataset structure and columns.

3. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - **Situation**: Ensuring the dataset is consistent and ready for analysis.
   - **Task**: Handle missing values, rename columns, and adjust data types.
   - **Action**: Utilized `isnull()`, `fillna()`, and `astype()` methods for cleaning.
   - **Result**: Produced a clean and consistent dataset for reliable analysis.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Situation**: Investigating data patterns and relationships.
   - **Task**: Summarize and visualize data to identify trends and anomalies.
   - **Action**: Used `describe()`, `groupby()`, and `plot()` functions for analysis and visualization.
   - **Result**: Extracted insights about key metrics, distributions, and group comparisons.
